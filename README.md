# Graphyne

**Graphyne** is a lightweight 3D game engine project built from the ground up, with a strong focus on low-level architecture and performance.  
It is currently in its early stages of development and aims to explore modern rendering techniques, multithreaded systems, and modular engine design.

> ⚙️ *This is a personal R&D project, and a first stepping stone toward a long-term goal: building a custom, proprietary game engine for creative and indie development.*

## Goals

- Window & input management via SDL
- Vulkan rendering backend
- Custom memory management
- Job system and async tasks
- Platform abstraction
- Simple scene & entity system

More features will come gradually as the engine evolves.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

> Graphyne is currently developed and maintained by a single developer ([@Multyp](https://github.com/Multyp)).  
> The repository is **not open to public contributions** at the moment, as the architecture and direction are still being defined.  
> However, **feedback, ideas, and technical discussions are very welcome** — feel free to open issues or reach out!
